== Natural numbers as lambda terms ==
=== Church numerals: ===
{{{
c0 = λs.λz.z
c1 = λs.λz.s(z)
c2 = λs.λz.s(s((z)))
...
cn = λs.λz.sn(z)
}}}

=== Definability ===
a function `f : N —> N` is definable in lambda calculus by term F if
`F[n] =β [ f (n) ]` for every n in N

for Church numerals only:
`F cn =β cf (n)`

You can define successor as:
`S = λx.λsz.s(xsz)` OR `S' = λx.λsz.xs(sz)`
