== Weak head normal form ==
at least one symbol is stable under reduction (the top part)

If the root is an abstraction, or applications with a variable on the left, it’s in WHNF.

every normal form is a WHNF, not necessarily the other way around.

examples: x, λx.x, xΩ, λx.Ω

If you reduce using lazy strategy, you only want to get into WH normal form.
