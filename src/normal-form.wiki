== Normal form ==
λ-term is in beta-normal (B-normal) form if it does not contain a beta-redex.
If it has a normal form, it can be reduced.

If it is _in_ normal form, it also _has_ a normal form.

A λ-term M is in normal form if:
* M = λx.M with M a normal form
* M = x M1 ... Mn with n ≥ 0 and M1...Mn normal forms

*Strongly normalising (terminating):* if all B-reduction sequences starting in M are finite (therefore also weakly normalising)

*Weakly normalising:* if there exists a B-reduction sequence starting in M that ends in a normal form
