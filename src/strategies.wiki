*strategy:* how to reduce a term

*normalising strategy:* gives a reduction sequence to a normal form. leftmost outermost.

e.g. given: (λy.z)(Ω)

{{local:../img/strategies.png|Strategies|style="max-width:50vw;max-height:30vh"}}

* Outermost: not contained in another redex
* Innermost: does not contain another redex
* Leftmost: the one most on the left obviously

=== Strategies ===
==== Call by need ====
reduce in every step the leftmost outermost redex. if it finds a loop, no normal form.

e.g. in above: (λy.z)(Ω) ➝ β z

another e.g.: (λx.fxx)((λx.x) 3) ➝ β f ((λx.x) 3) ((λx.x) 3) ➝ β f 3 3

pros:
* normalising
* all steps contribute to normal form

cons:
* redexes may be copied
* difficult to implement

==== Call by value ====
Reduce in every step the leftmost innermost redex.

e.g. in above: (λy.z)(Ω) ➝ β (λ.z)(Ω) ➝ β (λy.z)(Ω) ➝ β …

e.g.: (λx.fxx) ((λx.x)3) ➝ β (λx.fxx) 3 ➝ β f 3 3

pros:
* redexes not copied
* easy to implement

cons:
* not normalising
* reduction to normal form may reduce redexes that don’t contribute to normal form
